<img src="/photo.jpg" alt="Ariff Azraai">

Born in Kuantan, raised up in Kemaman and become native of Subang Jaya since 2005 (Albeit, there is some back story). Currently, read Mechatronics in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. Senior principal at [MentariWorks](http://mentariworks.com), director at [Imagineering](http://imagineering.my) and editor at [RENTAS & Coffeenion](http://rentas.institute).

"I build robot" is not accurate terms to describe me. Dabble in automation and software engineering. Prefer to read philosophy and history over love fictions.

Currently, technical lead for [JomSales](https://jomsales.com) and secretly building some automation project at Imagineering.
